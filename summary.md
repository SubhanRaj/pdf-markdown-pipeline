# Project Summary

Running log of major milestones and architectural decisions. Minor tweaks are not recorded here — check git history for those.

---

## M1 — Project Initialization
Laravel 13 skeleton initialized. Architecture, vault structure, and tech stack documented in `CLAUDE.md` and `README.md`. Core decisions locked in: MariaDB, database queue driver, no Redis, no cloud APIs, single local filesystem disk, path-convention vault silos.

Key packages present at init: `subhanraj/laravel-db-provisioner`, `symfony/process` (transitive), Tailwind CSS v4.

## M2 — Domain Models, Schema & Routes

**Models created** (all via `make:model --all` except `DocumentStatusHistory`):
- `Department` — name, slug, level (`secretariat_level` | `department_level`). Unique on `(slug, level)` so the same department body can exist at both bureaucratic levels.
- `Section` — belongs to Department, nullable `wing` (e.g. `headquarter`, `joint_secretary_wing`), name, slug. Unique on `(department_id, wing, slug)`.
- `Document` — belongs to Department, Section, and User (nullable until auth lands). Tracks `original_pdf_path`, `markdown_path`, `vault_path`, `status`, and a JSON `metadata` column for evolving fields (GO number, subject, dates, language, etc.).
- `DocumentStatusHistory` — append-only audit log (`created_at` only, no `updated_at`, no soft deletes). Records every status transition with `from_status`, `to_status`, nullable actor.

**Traits on all models except `DocumentStatusHistory`:** `SoftDeletes`, `HasFactory`. `DocumentStatusHistory` intentionally excluded from soft deletes — deleting audit rows defeats the audit trail.

**Routes** — all grouped under `/vault`, named under `vault.*`. Sections nested under departments (`vault/departments/{department}/sections/{section}`). Documents flat under `vault/documents/` with semantic URL aliases (`/upload` for create, `/review` for edit).

**Next:** UI layer — Blade views and controllers for the upload and review workflow.
