# CLAUDE.md

Context file for Claude Code working in this repository. Read this fully before making changes.

## Who you're working with

**Subhan Raj** — Lead CSE Engineer, SIBIN Tech Solutions. BTech CSE (KMCLU). Handles full-stack development and DevOps/sysadmin (Windows/macOS/Linux) for this project, working with the UP Department of Excise on internal IT and AMC hardware matters.

**Operating mode for this repo:** Senior Full-Stack Engineer / Systems Architect pair-programming session. Skip basic conceptual explanations — assume strong familiarity with PHP, Laravel, server administration, and web architecture. Provide production-ready, modular code and direct CLI steps rather than tutorials. When changing `.env` values, DB connections, or Python venv setup, summarize the change before executing it.

This repo and its context are scoped to engineering work only — no administrative/bureaucratic drafting persona applies here.

## Project overview

**`pdf-markdown-pipeline`** — a local-first document ingestion and conversion portal that transforms dense bureaucratic PDFs (Government Orders, service codes, policies, legacy court orders — English and Hindi/Rajbhasha) into clean, structured, AI-ready Markdown.

Built for the UP Department of Excise (and eventually Sugarcane & Sugar Industries), but the architecture is generic and open-source. Runs **100% on-premise** — no cloud APIs — due to government data-privacy mandates. Deployment targets: developer's Mac, departmental PC, or a local server (no Redis, no managed cloud services).

Core workflow: PDF upload → text extraction (or OCR fallback for scans) → human-in-the-loop split-pane review (original vs. rendered Markdown) → verified, frontmatter-tagged Markdown ready for downstream LLM/RAG use.

## Tech stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Framework | Laravel 13, PHP 8.4 |
| Database | MariaDB 12 |
| Frontend | Blade templates, Tailwind CSS v4, Parsedown (markdown render) |
| Text extraction | Python `markitdown`, via [`innobrain/markitdown`](https://github.com/innobraingmbh/markitdown) Laravel package (self-managed venv, `php artisan markitdown:install`) |
| OCR | Tesseract OCR (`hin` + `eng` language packs), invoked via `symfony/process`. Only triggered when markitdown output is empty/low-quality (i.e. scanned legacy GOs). |
| Queue | Laravel **database** queue driver — deliberately no Redis, single-box local deployment |
| Disk | Single local filesystem disk; logical separation enforced by path convention, not multiple disks |

## Document vault structure

Current scope is **Secretariat and Head Quarter level only**. Field offices (District Excise Officer, Deputy/Joint Excise Commissioner offices) are explicitly **out of scope** — rules, policies, and GOs are uniform across them, so no district-level breakdown is needed.

```

Reference org structure this is derived from:
- **Secretariat chain:** Hon'able Minister → Principal Secretary/Secretary/ACS → Special Secretary → [Joint Secretary | Deputy Secretary] → Section Officer → Section
- **Excise Department chain:** Excise Department → Head Quarter (11 sections listed above) / Field Office (out of scope for now)

Additional departments, wings, or sections can be added without restructuring existing branches.

## Database schema (in progress — expect frequent change)

Schema is intentionally not finalized. Structural columns are kept minimal; volatile/evolving fields go into a JSON `metadata` column rather than triggering new migrations on every iteration.

Planned core tables:
- **`documents`** — one row per ingested file: vault path, originating department/section/level, `status` (`uploaded → processing → review → verified`, plus `ocr_pending` / `failed`), original PDF path, converted Markdown path, uploading user, `metadata` JSON column.
- **`document_status_history`** — append-only audit log of state transitions (from/to status, actor, timestamp, note).
- **`users`** — department personnel with role/section assignments controlling vault access.
- **`departments`** / **`sections`** — reference tables defining the hierarchy above; used to enforce that a document's silo path matches its assigned department (Excise data must never resolve under a Sugarcane query, and vice versa).

## Architecture decisions already made (don't re-litigate without reason)

1. **Queue driver:** `database`, not Redis — no extra service to manage on a local single-box deployment.
2. **Text extraction:** `innobrain/markitdown` Composer package, `MARKITDOWN_USE_VENV_PACKAGE=true` — the package manages its own Python venv, so no hand-rolled subprocess/venv bridge is needed.
3. **OCR is conditional, not default** — only runs when markitdown returns near-empty/low-confidence text, to avoid wasting time OCR'ing native-text PDFs.
4. **Single disk, path-convention silos** — not multiple Laravel filesystem disks. Department/section isolation is enforced at the model/policy layer against the vault path convention above.
5. **Schema flexibility over premature normalization** — JSON `metadata` column absorbs new fields; promote to real columns only once a field has proven stable across iterations.
6. **No district/field-office granularity** in this phase — explicitly descoped.

## Conventions

- Bridge any new Python dependency through a Composer/Laravel package where one exists (as with `markitdown`) rather than raw `Process::run()` calls, unless no package exists.
- Long-running or potentially slow operations (extraction, OCR) must be dispatched as queued jobs — never run synchronously in a request/controller, to avoid browser timeouts.
- When generating migrations, prefer additive/nullable changes given the schema is still in flux.
